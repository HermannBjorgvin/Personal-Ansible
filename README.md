# My personal ansible setup

Trying to set up an ansible playbook for my development machines

---

Things to investigate later:

- Syncthing, also possible different sites, i.e. work/personal to not sync certain folders
- Synching firefox
- 1Password
- Gnome dconf for gnome terminal, default shell, background, and syncthing plugin

Current problems left to fix

- ZSH powerline fonts, looks like they're missing
